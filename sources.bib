  abstract="When choosing an industrial robot, repeatability is often one of the most important decision factors. But repeatability is not a global property, instead, it strongly depends on the robot's workspace position. This is currently ignored in robot cell planning leading to a loss of actual repeatability. This paper not only quantifies this loss but presents a new algorithm that finds the optimal position of a workpiece such that repeatability is optimized. The predictions of this algorithm are verified using digital twin simulations on different robots which show up to nine times higher repeatability than with the unoptimized position."
